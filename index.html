                                <p>This is my landing page on GitHub.  I am a tech enthusiast that taught myself all about computers years ago, at first, in order to squeeze just a bit more out of the setup I was using for gaming.
                                Soon enough I was spending more time optimizing and upgrading every piece of hardware and the network more than I was gaming. Many graphics cards, motherboards, Windows versions, and custom builds later I finally am in
								in a position to switch to a tech job which I should have done ages ago.</p>

                                contributors for their effort so scrubs like me can quickly build off your work. In the off chance you need a very quick bootstrap theme you can fork this repo and follow the instructions in the readme for a five minute solution.
								I have a few other of my repo's linked for past projects that need more attention, or learning programs I have worked on. Down below are some quick links for PHP and JS mainly for my use,

        <h5>Ground floor</h5>
        <p class="lead"> 
              Years back I was lucky enough to land a job as a cell phone sales rep just as this market was beginning to take off, and also got my first taste of programming.  I had an advantage over other employee's which was that I could program the phones that we sold, and also troubleshoot and configure network and security issues on site which led to 
              being promoted to district manager. All those hours in front of monitors and configuring networks for my gain, at the expense of siblings or roommates did pay off. The cell industry however, was extremely turbulent back then, and the growth pangs led to disappearance of the companies I worked for, Suncom and Alltel. 
		      This was no concern at the time, because there were a lot of opportunities out there for a twenty-something with a propensity for business and sales.   		 
	   </p>
       
       <p class="lead">
	          Now technology is on the ground floor of many other amazing breakthroughs in every catagory you can think of such as artificial intelligence, robotics, virtual reality and the list goes on.  A decade or two from now we will look back on this time as the stone ages and however big or small, I know that I want to contribute to this
			  new tech explosion in the same way that I did during the rise of mobile.

                 Is not something that people seek by nature in their lives, especially when it shakes your foundation and leaves you reeling like an unexpected jolt to the funny bone.  Change like this came in the form of losing a good job in business and sales because of the economy, 
			     but also provided a new perspective for reflecting and refocusing for the future.  Soon after I was back in school for a technical degree and working in a new career that would allow the extra time to do this. What started off as a painful job loss has now opened the doors to    
                 the field that I should be in anyhow. The signs were quite obvious, such as the feeling of achievement after solving someone else's tech nightmare, or lately, writing an algorythm which does as it is intended.

			<h5>The Shotgun Approach</h5>
			
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm-8">
			<p class="lead">
			     Between the contraints of a sixty hour work week, family life and school on the weekends, its hard to focus on anything besides what has to be done.  Fortunately, my school finally ended in December
				 and once the reigns were cut lose, I was reading and trying to assimilate every piece of information that was programming or otherwise.  This was great and all, but reality set in after a month of spending my
				 weekends reading five languages, and trying to learn about and use the current trends for each, that the shotgun approach to this was simply not going to work. 
			</p>

            <p class="lead">
                 My approach in the last few weeks has been much more focused, sticking with what I know I will use right now instead of trying to build an encyclopedic knowledge of all programming aspects. For now this invovles
				 staying fresh with HTML, CSS, JS, using helpful tools such as NodeJS, NPM. a couple IDE's, and Abobe CC if needed.  I have been using freecodecamp as well for the practise with algorythms and to learn through repetition. 
                 Even though it is tempting to to begin chasing the rabbit with certifications, that is a really expensive endeavor until I know for certain what technologies I will be using in my next career.

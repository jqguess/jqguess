        <h5>The Big One </h5>
        <p class="lead"> I will be the first to admit that following our political landscape is not high on everyone’s to do list and I get it. 
        This could be because for some the whole thing seems hopeless, for others what has or hasn’t happened infuriates you, and for the rest you may not have the time or really couldn’t care less. 
        If you fall into one of those categories, then this is written for you.  What you will get is an overview of where we are at with the choices we have ahead and what they could mean.
        Even though this is my opinion and the conclusions are from my experience after years of following the subject, I don't expect or intend to sway your feelings
        one way or the other; I only want to inform you!
       </p>
       
       <p class="lead">Without delving into the last 7 years and whether we agree or not, the fact is this country has been changed significantly by its progressive leadership. 
       Enough so, that Trump and Sanders are doing really well this cycle, when in the past they would have never gained any traction with the American people. Also, the next President could pick up to four new Supreme Court appointees,
       and if you remember the last few big rulings, such as the un-affordable healthcare act, you can imagine how important this is.  So we are left major choices, which can be boiled down into four categories....

            <h6>Keywords: Progressive, Clinton, Bush, more of the same </h6>
            <p class="lead">
            If you really liked the trajectory of the last decade, then you will want Clinton for progressivism or Bush for more of the same. These leaders intervene in <strong>all</strong> aspects of citizens lives, and even foriegn
            affairs are subject to their will. Because after all, the ruling class with the power knows what is best for "You the People." They believe that progress, usually against others will, is necessary. And that government should have
            more control and power to make wise decisions that you would not yet understand, because your frontal-lobe is still underdeveloped.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">The arrogance of the progressive elite can be noticed in the dangerous intervention approach to foreign policy of the last decade, and in the weakened economic system which has been masked by zero interest, an endless money spigot, and a lapdog media.
            Yet these masters of thought and knowledge do not realize that they are suffocating the engine of capitalism, small business, with their 300+ new regulations per day. They also alienate a vast majority of American's by systemically removing
            aspects of the Christian faith from public view and punish those who try to practice as they see fit. Yet, they will make extra accomodations for other religions, because we need to be more accepting after all.

            <p class="lead">Socialism- The step in between capitalism and communism. If you know history, this choice should scare you, because it is basically the end of the American experiment. 
            We already know how this story ends, yet people refuse to learn from history.  In their arrogance people believe it never worked because it was implemented the wrong way in the past, or they parrot my personal favorite, 
            “This is actually democratic socialism, much better than the real socialism!” -Uh-huh, sure
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
             Bernie happens to be right that the game is rigged, but his solution is <em>more</em> of what caused many problems in the first place! In order to understand why this will not work, we have to understand what makes us exceptional as a Nation. 
             It's not about our ego, its about our freedom. The vast majority of people who have lived
             did so under tyrany, oppression and fear of their leaders. When the pilgrims fled tyranny in England and formed this country where the leaders serve the people, it was an <strong> exception </strong>to the norm. Years later our founding documents
             cemented this freedom by giving the most power to the people, and limiting the role of government in our lives. -Credit to R.L. on this definition.
             </p>
             <p class="lead">
             Under socialism, we would cede our freedoms back to the government at a much quicker rate than we already are. The government would take from the successful, through obscene tax rates,
             and give it to those who are not productive in our society after wasting a significant portion. This would eliminate the incentive for being successful, inovative and having an entrepreneur's spirit.
             Capitalism would end as we know it, which is the reason our standards of living are much higher than most of the world. -But at least we would get free stuff!

            Let me first say I completely understand Trumps supporters.  They have been beaten down for the last seven years and they are angry. 
            Some want the opposition to pay and they really just want the America back that they know, and an end to the games in D.C.   
            Trump’s success would have never happened without the interventionist policies of the current regime and the failure of the Republican held senate and congress 
            to do a thing about it. I believe the Don does want us to win again, although if I voted for him, it would be a vote against something worse, namely the progressive left.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
            The reason is because I do not know what his foundation is.  Will he be an authoritarian leader who grasps more power under the pretense of doing what’s right? Will he use arms of the executive
            branch like the IRS to attack opponents like our current President does?  I really cannot answer questions like this without taking a gamble that Trump leans toward the Constitution 
            instead of the allure of power. Another thing I have noticed is the similar attitude that some Trump supporters have compared to Obamas supporters in the two previous elections.  
            There is simply nothing The Don can say or do that would sway there vote.  This is why he can get away with blunders which would have ended any other campaign of the past.
           </p>
           <p class="lead">
            Even though he does have a path to victory, I can guarantee that the left will open the gates of hell on Trump when he secures the nomination. Have you noticed they are not
           attacking him right now? NBC recently purchased the rights to a older movie on Trump, which they are sitting on for now.  Also, there is a movie in production by Ron Howard starring
           Johnny Depp as Trump. Can you see anything going wrong here in November? I really hope not!.

        <h4>The Constitution</h4>
        <h6>Keywords:  Firebrand, The Constitution's best friend, Humble, Conservative, Truth</h6>
        <p class="lead">
        This category got smaller when Rand Paul dropped out, and Rubio is about a 7/10 in this group.  The main contender then is Ted Cruz, who I like because he has the rare quality of making promises, and then actually keeping them.
        Check his voting record and take it to the bank that Ted will do <em><strong>Exactly What He Said He Would Do.</strong></em> 
        This has not made him popular, because career politicians know he is serious about restoring the Constitution and they will fight to keep that money flowing with the status quo. Despite no help 
        from Washington, and no help from the media such as Fox news and the Drudge report, his grassroots campaign is steaming ahead. He has spend a fraction of other campaigns so far, and won in Iowa, and
        placed third in New Hampshire which is one of the more difficult states for a candidate like Cruz. 
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
        Ted was raised with a Constitution in one hand and a Bible in the other. At age 13 he had memorized the Constitution under the instruction of his dad who escaped socialist Cuba for freedom in America.
        He has done well in this election so far, but will need Christians of all walks to show up to vote; the same group who did not show for Romney in the last election. What Rush has to say about Cruz is "that       
        if conservatism is the answer, then Ted Cruz is your guy. He is the closest we have seen to Regean since Renaldus Magnus himself."
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
        For me, a vote for Cruz is a vote for the Constitution and a step toward the principles that we were founded on. No one man can fix all the problems we face, and there is no <em>perfect</em> candidate.
        But, a man who uses the Constitution and Bible for guidance, and is not in pursuit of power, will return us to a nation closer to what was envisioned at its founding. Because of the major differences in these 
        four choices we have, this really is <em>The Big One.</em>
